1. Run `meteor`. Wait for it to start the server
2. Run `meteor mongo` to get the mongo console up
3. Make sure your users collection is cleared by typing `db.users.drop()` in the mongo console
4. Insert a few fake users into the database by typing `load('Users.txt')` in the mongo console
5. Go to localhost:3000 and sign in with your @pdx email
6. Your account should now be created. Refresh your page and open up the javascript console (right-click -> inspect source -> console)
7. In the javascript console, type Meteor.userId()
8. Copy the result into your clipboard
9. Open up the file PushUserReviews.txt and replace every occurence of <METEOR_USER_ID> with the id you just copied, surrounded by quotes
10. Go back to your mongo console and type `load('PushUserReviews.txt')`
11. You should now have some fake users in mongo and your user object should have some reviews attached to it. 
12. To verify that all of the users were added, type `db.users.find()` into the mongo console. Look for your user document entry to double check that the reviews were correctly pushed to your reviews array
